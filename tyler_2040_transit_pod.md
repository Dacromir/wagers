# Tyler Wins
- This will be available in South Jordan (Bridle Oak Drive)
- There will be an autonomous, driverless vehicle that can pick you up at your house and drop you off at your place of work
- This will be a pod/bus that takes at minimum 5 separate passengers
	- Each passenger picked up at their house (within 300 feet)
- This would work for 50% of people
	- Not everyone can - depends on how concentrated their place of work is
		- This will take you to an office park
		- This won't take you a farm in the country
- Taking this transit every day for commute (both ways) will be cheaper than a $15,000 (in 2024 money) used car
	- Use $12.50 per daily commute (round trip) / $6.25 one way as an approximation
	- This transit option has to be economical for at least half (ish) the people in the area
		- Eric agrees to be generous on this point
		- The idea is that some people will be outliers (e.g. work far away from where they live) and this may not work for them. Most people work near where they live, and this should work for them.
# Eric Wins
- The above does not exist on Jan 1, 2040
# Wager Terms
- The winner gets to name the loser's next pet
	- The winner can choose to pass on a pet if they don't want to name it
	- E.g. you can skip naming a goldfish to attempt to hold out for a dog
- Subject to veto by the loser's SPOUSE, but not by the loser or their progeny
# Historical Record
- This wager was struck after a two-hour argument on Discord at 9-11pm on 2024-12-12
	- Eric insisted that this solution was not possible due to engineering/physics constraints
	- Tyler thinks that Eric's solutions (buses, light rail, streetcars) are less realistic than this due to American car culture and current infrastructure
